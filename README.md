# javascript_challenge

- Create a basic HTML web page using bootstrap.

- Use a UFO dataset that's in the form of an array of JavaScript objects.

- Write code that appends a table to the new web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

- Use a date form in the HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
